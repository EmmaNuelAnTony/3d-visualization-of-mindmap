The project target is to come up with a solution to the problem of finding an **optimum way to represent a mind map in 3-D** while harnessing the power of modern touch interfaces. We propose designing a solution that will maximize data visibility and contextual appropriateness. Extensive research will be carried out to unveil the possibilities of combining different user interface techniques to materialize the objective. Also included in the plan is to innovatively utilize state-of-the-art user interface design techniques and cognitive science findings to bring computer-aided mind mapping into the next level. We propose bringing the new conceptual solution into play in the grounds of emerging Windows 8 platform as a metro-style proof-of-concept application. Dissenting from the popular practice of providing already acquainted mind map users with a software tool, we hope to develop a solution that promotes mind mapping as a widespread practice.
